    {$\bullet$ Investigation on applying efficient active learning method to boost the training of protein-drug reaction result prediction matrix. \\
    $\bullet$ From perspective of data distribution, according to the property of matrix-form data structure, adjusting the configuration of data to fit the RBF kernel based Beysian Optimization method $\&$ random forest regression method based on available sampling data points when training. As a result, combined with traditional active learning strategy, the training process via active learning becomes more efficient, with about 25$\%$ speed improvement to reach the same predict precision. Code can be found in \url{https://github.com/SWY666/Gifts-for-Pro.Murphy}.\\
    $\bullet$ Based on experiment results, published them as my first paper on EIECT 2021, and promised letter of recommendation.}

    {$\bullet$ Investigation on effective and less constrained backdoor $\&$ poison attack strategy on self-supervised learning method. \\
    $\bullet$ Reimplement classical backdoor $\&$ poison attack and defence strategy, conclude that there exists limitation for their effective working, such as the demanding scale of pattern (defend) and dependence on the knowledge of label information in datasets (attack $\&$ defend).\\
    $\bullet$ Applying min-min optimization to alternatively train trigger $\&$ poison to generate more robust attacking pattern. Currently gain about 10\% attack success rate enhancement on BYOL and MoCo (currently reported best attack success rate), and without the necessity to stick triggers on same category.\\
    $\bullet$ Due to loss function's mechanism of MoCo, which results into attack success rate droping during the downstream training on clean datasets, attempt to apply gradient matching strategy to brew attack patterns to solve this problem.\\
    $\bullet$ Still ongoing, gain the acknowledgement of my Internship tutor, with \textbf{return offer} and letter of recommendation.}

    {$\bullet$ Investigation on video-based remote heart rate detection method. Design relative algorithm and corresponding engineering realization. \\
    $\bullet$ Teamwork with other team members (mainly focus on the development of physiological signal extraction algorithm), published online functional platform \url{http://sass.zerorui.cn/#/home}. It can recognize registered users through webcams and report their current heart rate $\&$ other health indicators, then save them into database using Mysql. \\
    $\bullet$ Also implement offline UI product by myself on windows and linux operation system using python and cython, code can be found in \url{https://github.com/SWY666/rPPG_UI_interface}. \\
    $\bullet$ Training related heart rate estimation end-to-end network structure demands on forms of dataset, due to the physiological delay between label waves and real faical heart rata signal.   design special label representation method to conquer such defect of datasets and lead to convenient and efficient network training. Moreover, proposed method can reach the \textbf{SOTA} remote heart rate prediction precision on mostly used dataset. Work has been submitted to AAAI 2023 and under review, also published corresponding patent, code can be find on \url{https://github.com/SWY666/BYHE}.}
